    title: "What is a POS system?",
    description: `
        A POS system—POS stands for point of sale—is a suite of software and hardware that gives businesses the ability to sell products and services, manage inventory, track sales performance, build customer relationships, and much more. Most POS systems seen in businesses today are actually ePOS systems, or electronic points of sale, as they operate online and store information in the cloud.

        The simplest way to understand a POS system is to think of it as a more modern cash register that can do so much more than just ring up customers.

        Let’s break it down into the two main components of a POS system, POS hardware and POS software.

        POS hardware is a blanket term for the physical components of your POS system. There will be some differences in the types of hardware your business needs depending on whether you run a retail or a hospitality business. However, there will be some commonalities regardless of your industry.

        - **Tablet or computer**—This is the device where your POS software is installed or accessed so your laptop can be used as a POS system. It’s where you and your staff will interact with your POS day-to-day. Most modern POS systems run on iPads or Android tablets. However, some will also run from desktop computers.
        - **Card terminal**—This piece of hardware is how you take payments with your POS. It allows you to accept electronic payments like credit and debit cards, as well as mobile payments like Apple Pay and Google Pay.
        - **Cash drawer**—This is a part of your POS cash register set up, allowing you to store cash, receipts, and other important documents during shifts. A cash register is not a POS system in and of itself, but rather a crucial component.
        - **Kitchen printer**—These allow you to send orders right to the kitchen where the staff can print them out for reference while making orders. These use ink and paper that can handle the high heat and humidity of kitchen environments.
        - **Kitchen display**—Similar to a kitchen printer, this digital monitor allows you to display orders for your kitchen staff.
        - **Barcode scanner**—If you use barcodes in your retail shop, this scanner can read your codes, allowing you to ring up customers faster and more accurately.

        POS software is the actual software application that runs on your tablet or computer. While there are many different vendors, most POS software does include some common functions.

        - **Register**—The register component is customer-facing and it’s where your staff actually rings up transactions for customers.
        - **Inventory management**—Whether it involves adding new stock, updating inventory levels, or looking at your inventory turnover rate, inventory management is a major component of POS software.
        - **Reporting and analytics**—These tools allow you to monitor sales data, uncover trends, track profitability, and much more.
        - **Selling online**—You need a POS system for online business. Today’s modern POS software often includes or integrates with an ecommerce platform, allowing you to sell online, while also syncing inventory and other data with your POS.
        - **Customer marketing**—Most POS software includes some basic marketing functionality like a CRM component, while also integrating with more powerful marketing tools.

    title: "What is the best POS system for a small business?",
    description: `Selecting the best POS system for your small business can be a difficult choice—the only thing you know for sure is that yes, you do need a POS system for your business.

      "What is the difference between a POS system and a payment processor?",
    description: `A point of sale system is used to track and manage your inventory and ring up sales. A payment processor handles the actual transaction during sales.

Payment processors transmit payment information between relevant parties to complete transactions—information will be sent between your business' bank account and the paying customer’s bank, for example, or between your acquiring bank and the customer’s credit card issuer.

A point of sale system facilitates the transaction in question—if a payment processor connects to your bank, your POS system powers your till. POS systems like Lightspeed can integrate with payment processors to automatically transit information between your inventory system and card reader. In addition, Lightspeed includes tools for inventory management, CRM and data analysis, and we have even developed our own payment processing system: Lightspeed Payments.`,

    title: "Does a POS system need Internet?",
    description: `Generally, yes, a cloud-based POS system needs the internet at least some of the time for various functions, such as processing credit card transactions, updating inventory in real time and syncing sales data to other systems for analytics and reporting.

        An internet-connected POS system is generally a better choice than a server-based POS, because it offers more reliability in transaction handling, allows for seamless updates and integrations with other cloud-based services and provides access to real-time data from any location without extra costs of hosting your servers yourself.`,
